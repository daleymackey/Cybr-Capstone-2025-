# Cybr-Capstone-2025-
This REPO will be used for Kennesaw State's 2025 Capstone 
## Steps to take 
- Email professor about the following [X]: 
    - We can create a Gantt Chart but don't understand if we are assigned a VM
    - Are we able to do anything for security 
    - Are there specific guidelines 
    - Are we required to use specific technologies 
    - Scenario is E-Commerce 
## Professor Response : 
- On the beginning document, it states we will be assigned a VM, when will this happen? We feel without it we cannot completely fill out the Gantt chart with deliverables until we have this information." ----- I am actively working with the CCSE IT team to set up the VM for this class. It will be completed very soon. I will update the class once I get a green signal from them. Regarding the Gantt chart, you can provide a tentative at this point, and that is completely fine. 

- "Are we able to do "anything" for security, or will you be assigning specifics?" ----- For this class, I want you to leverage all the learnings and techniques you have learned and experiences you have so far in this program to conduct a small research that the end product will be a prototype of something usable. There is no specific limitation or particular assignment of the project to each group-- I want you to push your boundaries and do something innovative. I have only two requirements from my side-- the project needs to be relevant to cybersecurity, and the end product must be a prototype of a usable system. I will evaluate the technical rigor, usefulness, usability, and significance of the project at the end, not which context you chose for this. 

- Are there specific guidelines we must follow? ----- It is primarily a set of group research activities. The provided instructions will suffice to be followed. Please adhere to the plan for each of the three phases. 

- Are we required to use specific technologies----- No, you have the freedom to design your problem/project and leverage technologies that best fit the interest of the project. 

From our understanding the scenario is E-Commerce for Everything Organic, is this correct? ----- No, please read the response above.
### Phase 1 
#### Business Scenario 
Everything Organic is a small business that sell organic vegetables produced
by local framers. Everything Organic use an ecommerce website to sell its products directly to
the customers. The ecommerce web site is hosted in its own server located at company promise
#### Planning  
The student team is required to create a project plan which includes a list of project
management related tasks: 
1) identify and review the project requirements; 
2) elect a team lead;
3) specify the role of each member in the team; 
4) develop strategies for the communication and
team collaboration.
Each team will be given access to a virtual machine. The VM is a MS Window OS with a
database server and web server for e-commence site
#### Deliverable 
A project plan should be submitted to the corresponding D2L assignment drop box.
A template will be provided to guide the plan development. The project plan may be adjusted
later in the semester but should be fully justified and documented

### Project Progression 
#### Phase 1 
Each student team reviews the technical environment in the VM and business requirements. The
student teams will be given a list of the security products that they can use to protect the systems.
Then each team develop a security program for the small business which includes: 
1) information security policy for the organization; 
2) technical plan on protecting the systems of Everything Organic;
3) the students should purposely leave a vulnerability in their security program (for other team exploit). The student team is expected to implement the security program in the assigned VM.

### Deliverable 
2.2. Phase 2 – vulnerability exploitation
Each student team is given the URL of the ecommerce site that another team is in charge of
protecting. The student team exploits the vulnerability/weakness of the assigned URL.
Deliverable: Project phase 2 report include tools and strategies used to exploit the assigned URL
and discoveries from the exploitation. The report should be submitted to the corresponding D2L
assignment drop box by the end of week 5. Detailed requirements on the report is available in
D2L course site.
2.3. Phase 3 – vulnerability exploitation
Each student team is given the security program developed by team who is in charge of
protecting assigned URL. Each team is also given the vulnerabilities discovered by other team.
The report in this phase should include: 
1) examinations of the systems for traces of exploitation;
2) reflections on the vulnerability reports from the other team;
3) reflections the security program
provided by the other teams.
Deliverable: Project phase 3 report should be submitted to the corresponding D2L assignment
drop box by the end of week 6. Detailed requirements on the report is available in D2L course
site. Detailed requirements on the report is available in D2L course site.
3. Project Conclusion
In the week 7 the semester, student teams should work on conclusion of the project which
include following items.
• Final project submission – the project can be compiled based on phase 1, phase 2, and
phase 3 report. Detailed instructions on can be found in D2L course site.
• Project presentation – Each team is required to create 10-15 minutes recorded
presentation for their project. Detailed instruction can be found in the D2L course site.
• Peer evaluation - Each student receives the average of the peer evaluations of team
members. A student will be considered as significantly lack of contribution if the grade is
less than 10 (out of 20) and may potentially fail the course. Detailed instruction can be
found in the D2L course site.
