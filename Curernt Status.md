- **Impact**: More verbose chart code but same functionality
- **Workaround proven successful** for all chart types

### Recommended Chart Libraries:
- **Plotly Graph Objects**: Primary choice (ARM64 compatible)
- **Plotly Express**: Avoid due to pandas dependency
- **Dash Bootstrap Components**: Working perfectly for styling

### Data Processing Strategy:
- ‚úÖ **Polars for data operations** (groupby, filtering, sorting)
- ‚úÖ **Direct list extraction** from Polars DataFrames (.to_list())
- ‚úÖ **No pandas conversion needed** with Graph Objects approach
- ‚úÖ **Fast performance** maintained
