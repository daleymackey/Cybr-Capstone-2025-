## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Dashboard Status:
- ‚úÖ **Tab 1 (Web Server Analytics): COMPLETE** - 4 functional charts implemented
- Dashboard navigation and data loading working properly
- Modular structure established for remaining tabs

### **IMPORTANT: ARM64 Environment Considerations**
- **Pandas installation fails** on ARM64 Windows architecture
- **Solution**: Using Plotly Graph Objects instead of Plotly Express
- **Impact**: More verbose chart code but same functionality
- **Workaround proven successful** for all chart types

### Recommended Chart Libraries:
- **Plotly Graph Objects**: Primary choice (ARM64 compatible)
- **Plotly Express**: Avoid due to pandas dependency
- **Dash Bootstrap Components**: Working perfectly for styling

### Data Processing Strategy:
- ‚úÖ **Polars for data operations** (groupby, filtering, sorting)
- ‚úÖ **Direct list extraction** from Polars DataFrames (.to_list())
- ‚úÖ **No pandas conversion needed** with Graph Objects approach
- ‚úÖ **Fast performance** maintained
