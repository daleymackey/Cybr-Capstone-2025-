### Instructions 
Several student groups reached out requesting adjustments to project objectives based on the time remaining in the semester. I reviewed all the concerns and made changes to the Capstone Project expectations to make them more practical, achievable, and potentially showcaseable for future opportunities. Please review the updated plan closely.

You have access to five synthetic datasets representing cybersecurity elements for ‚ÄúEverything Organic.‚Äù These datasets include (please see the attached):

Web Server Access Logs
User Authentication Logs
Malware and Threat Alerts
Network Traffic Summary
Security Incident Reports
Each dataset comes with a data dictionary to help you understand the context and meaning of the fields. These are synthetic datasets created specifically for this class and are not reflective of real-world data. I have also cleaned the data to minimize the need for preprocessing.

üéØ Project Objective

Using these datasets and your Python skills, you are expected to build a data science app using Python Dash. This app should visually present and interpret the cybersecurity posture of Everything Organic. You may refer to Python Dash examples for guidance (Plotly Dash App Examples). You are welcome to use a wide range of suitable analytics or visualization methods. The final app should include three main features (tabs). Each feature should have two to four subfeatures that demonstrate your analysis or interpretation to discuss the cybersecurity posture of Everything Organic.
